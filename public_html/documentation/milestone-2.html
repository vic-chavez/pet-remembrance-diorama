The final section of this area will showcase a Jumbotron with a mission statement and a picture of our final product.</p>

<p><strong>How It Works:</strong>This area is showcasing the entire process from start to finish in a card layout. Each card will have a title, picture and text explaining the procedure. There are a total of 6 cards. In addition, there will be a series of arrows showcasing the direction of travel.</p>
